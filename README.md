IBM i "subfile" used as a datagrid.
This display file routine was developed to demonstrate how an IBM i Display File using a "subfile" can emulate a Datagrid. The rows of data are gathered using a single SQL Fetch Multiple Rows into an array datastructre. Each column can be used to gather data by the catagorie's heading. Once the data is gathered, it can be sorted by double left mouse clicking on the column's input field. This example is based on a CRM customer table. The supporting tabel is the Account Executive table. The A/E table is used to restrict the user's access of the customer table to just that A/E's leads (customers).gi
